# Unified-Blockchains
Data analysis toolkit for data across blockchains

This repository combines data from multiple blockchains in different formats into a standard, unified format, in order to perform analyses across blockchains agnostic of the initial format of the underlying blockchains. Tools to do sample analyses using both SQL and a distributed map reduce with pandas are given to show what can be done for any blockchain.
